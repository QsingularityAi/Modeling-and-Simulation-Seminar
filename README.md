# Project Name:- Mathematical Modelling of thin membrane

Project Discription: This work aims to show that a simple, structured, and efficient shape optimization framework can be written by using finite element software AMDiS(TU Dresden finite Element software library). This is illustrated by the implementation of a classical technique called geometrical optimization for such type of problem. we modeled theoretical and computational work for 2D Problems to develop robust technique. Our computational results is very useful for engineers or researchers.
