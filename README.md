# Project Name:- Mathematical Modelling of thin membrane

Project Discription: This work aims to show that a simple, structured, and efficient shape optimization framework can be written by using finite element software AMDiS(TU Dresden finite Element software C++ library). This is illustrated by the implementation of a classical technique called geometrical optimization for such type of problem. we modeled theoretical and computational work for 2D Problems to develop robust technique. Our computational results is very useful for engineers or researchers.

# Project Configration

As above mention this project requried TU Dresden AMDiS Framework. It can easily setup in MacOS,Linux and Windows(better use Linux Subsystem).
In linux it is very easy to configation for this project.


1 - Install Download  VS Code editer 

2 - Install boost library : sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev 

3 - Install cmake :- sudo apt-get -y install cmake 

4 - Install SuiteSparse :- sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev 

5 - Install PNG :- sudo apt-get install libpng-dev 

6 - Install gcc 4.9 or g++ 4.9 , might be this available just check it if not you should install. 

7 - Install Git: sudo apt install git.

Download Modsem_2020 unzip in home
Locate AMDiS folder and Create build folder form terminal
cd /home/happyonu/Modsem_2020/AMDiS/build$ make


RUN this : cmake -S cd /home/happyonu/Modsem_2020/AMDiS' (locate amdis in your system ) -B  
cd home/happyonu/Modsem_2020/modsem_2020/build' (locate build directry in you syatem)

then open
build folder in terminal Run command : make
